# User Deletion Fix - Complete Resolution

## üéØ Problem Summary

User deletion was failing silently. When attempting to delete a user from the Team page, the user would not be removed from the database.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Issue:** The `profiles` table had a foreign key constraint to `auth.users(id)` **WITHOUT** the `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause.

**Deletion Flow:**
1. UI calls `/api/team/[id]` DELETE endpoint
2. API calls `deleteAuthenticatedUser(userId)` function
3. Function deletes all user-related data (tasks, projects, comments, etc.)
4. Function calls `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(userId)` to delete from `auth.users`
5. ‚ùå **PostgreSQL blocks deletion** ‚Üí Foreign key constraint violation because `profiles` table still references the user

**Why it failed:**
- The `profiles` table definition:
  ```sql
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY  -- Missing ON DELETE CASCADE!
  ```
- When trying to delete from `auth.users`, PostgreSQL refused because the profile still existed
- The function didn't explicitly delete the profile before deleting the auth user

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Fix (lib/db.ts)
Added explicit profile deletion BEFORE `auth.admin.deleteUser()`:

```typescript
// Step 10: Delete the user's profile (CRITICAL - must happen before auth user deletion)
// The profiles table has FK to auth.users without CASCADE, so we must delete it explicitly
const { error: profileError } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .delete()
  .eq('id', userId);

// Step 11: Delete user from auth.users (profile is now gone, so this will succeed)
const { error } = await supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(userId);
```

### 2. Schema Fix (Migration: 20251010000000_fix_profiles_cascade_delete.sql)
Added `ON DELETE CASCADE` to profiles foreign key constraint:

```sql
-- Drop the existing foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE public.profiles
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_id_fkey;

-- Add the foreign key constraint back with ON DELETE CASCADE
ALTER TABLE public.profiles
ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_id_fkey
  FOREIGN KEY (id)
  REFERENCES auth.users(id)
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### 3. Security Enhancement (app/api/team/[id]/route.ts)
Added authentication check in the API route:

```typescript
// Verify caller is authenticated (security check before allowing deletion)
const supabase = await createClient();
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

if (!user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Automated Test
Created comprehensive test script: `scripts/test-user-deletion.ts`

**Test Results:** ‚úÖ **PASSED**
- ‚úÖ Profile deleted
- ‚úÖ Project deleted
- ‚úÖ Task deleted
- ‚úÖ Comment deleted
- ‚úÖ Auth user deleted
- ‚úÖ No orphaned records

**Run test anytime:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-user-deletion.ts
```

### Manual Testing
1. Go to `/team` page
2. Click trash icon on any user
3. Confirm deletion in dialog
4. User should be immediately removed from the list
5. All user data (tasks, projects, comments, messages) are deleted

## üìã What Gets Deleted

When a user is deleted, the following data is permanently removed:

1. **User Profile** - From `profiles` table
2. **Tasks** - All tasks created by the user
3. **Projects** - All projects created by the user
4. **Comments** - All comments made by the user
5. **Task Files** - All files uploaded by the user
6. **Messages** - All messages sent by the user
7. **Chats** - All chats created by the user
8. **Chat Participants** - User's participation in all chats
9. **User Invitations** - All invitations sent by the user
10. **Team Members** - All team member records created by the user
11. **Auth User** - User's authentication record

## üîê Security Considerations

- Only authenticated users can delete other users
- The deletion function uses service role client to bypass RLS for complete cleanup
- No manual auth check in `deleteAuthenticatedUser` since it's an internal function using service role
- API route handles authentication verification

## üìù Developer Notes

### Defensive Programming
The fix implements **both** code-level and schema-level solutions:
- **Code**: Explicitly deletes profile (works even if schema isn't fixed)
- **Schema**: CASCADE ensures automatic deletion (works for any direct deletions)

This double protection ensures reliability even if one mechanism fails.

### Function Usage
```typescript
import { deleteAuthenticatedUser } from '@/lib/db';

// Delete a user and all their data
const success = await deleteAuthenticatedUser(userId);

if (success) {
  console.log('User deleted successfully');
} else {
  console.error('User deletion failed');
}
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] Root cause identified via deep sequential analysis
- [x] Code fix implemented in `lib/db.ts`
- [x] Migration created and applied to database
- [x] API route secured with authentication check
- [x] Automated test created and passing
- [x] Manual testing successful
- [x] All user data properly cleaned up
- [x] No orphaned records remain

## üöÄ Status: RESOLVED

User deletion is now working perfectly. The issue is fixed both at the code level and the database schema level, ensuring long-term reliability.
